Part 1: Discussion 


1. What are the three main design advantages that object orientation
   can provide? Explain each concept.


2. What is a class?


3. What is an instance attribute?  
	An instance attribute is an attribute specific to an instantiation of a class. 
	Example:  ANIMAL is the super class. CAT, DOG and WHALE are sub classes.
	An instance attribute of CAT is specific to CAT, WHALE to WHALE.
	The instance attribute may or may not be relevant to other animals.   
	Example: 
	    All CATs are species: cat, habitat: land, breathes underwater: False. 
	    All WHALES are species: whale, habitat: ocean, breathes underwater: True. 

4. What is a method?
	

5. What is an instance in object orientation?
	

6. How is a class attribute different than an instance attribute?
   Give an example of when you might use each.

	Example: 
	    Super Class = ANIMALS
	    	species: None
	    	habitat: None
	    	fur: None
	    	habitat: None
	    	mammal: False
	    	food: None
